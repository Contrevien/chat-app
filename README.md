# Un-named Chat Application

This a personal project and was created for fun and learning the concepts of integrating react with firebase.

It is group chat application, everyone with a private key has access to chat in the group.

Everyone without the private key, can still use the public key to view the conversations in the group. But they cannot participate in the conversations.

Todo:
- Add Router to manage Login page and the Conversation page.
- Add Colors for different names
- Add more To-do entries :p
